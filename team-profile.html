<p style="text-align:justify;">Addie’s Reflection:<br>

<br><br>
Gabriel’s Reflection:<br>
These results give me confidence in working in a team environment. The results show that I am open-minded and flexible.
This enables me to adapt, be open to new ideas or change direction if needed. Knowing that I am a visual learner means
I would convey my ideas visually, for example, visual content would be easier for me to create and express.
In order to come up with new ideas and solutions, I will need to work on my creativity level as reflected in the test results.
Overall, I think that I am able to work efficiently in a team and will endeavour to develop my skills as I develop my project experience.<br><br>
Isaac’s Reflection:<br>
As the protagonist I do feel that I took a leadership role in the team, helping with the delegation of tasks
and support to the rest of the team. With my persistence, curiosity and visual learning style, I have been able
to continue through trial and error to improve aspects even if there was already a suitable outcome.<br><br>
Jack’s Reflection:<br>

<br><br>
Group Reflection:<br>
With a mixed bag of protagonists, entertainers, defenders and campaigners we cover all the bases. We have clear leadership,
critical thinking, people skills & enthusiasm which allows us to complete all tasks in front of us in a timely
manner and with customer satisfaction.<br><br><br>
Ideal Jobs <br>
We at Fully Developed, not only have a large variety of backgrounds and skills, but also share a strong array
of job aspirations that we currently aspire towards in our future career endeavours. <br><br>
Isaac: Cyber Security Manager <br>
Developing and maintaining cyber security that allows him to not only work with skilled peers,
but help people maintain their personal cyber security. <br><br>
Addie: Data Business Analyst <br>
Deriving data in order to present ideas to both management and stakeholders of a company, in
order to maximise business productivity and efficiency. <br><br>
Gabriel: Lead Game Designer <br>
Using creativity and complex game design knowledge to create, world-class entertainment for the enjoyment of millions of users.<br><br>
Jack: IT Portfolio Financial Analyst <br>
Deriving market data from a variety of sources to spot trends and opportunities in financial markets that could maximise
investor wealth and financial security. <br><br>
With all of these diverse career paths, Fully developed brings together a team that similarly wants to pursue
paths in the IT industry, although across a variety of fields. It is interesting to see how our team, although
at similar stages of our learning, have many similarities amongst the group. Both Addie and Jack’s career choices
draw inspiration from the analysis of data for business functions, when Isaac and Gabriel’s choices show their
desire to pursue development and creation of IT services.</p><br>
