<p style="text-align:justify;">Group Processes:<br>
Our team has worked efficiently, we have communicated well with each other and have openly discussed our ideas and plans.
For this next assignment we will be creating a project from an entirely new idea and perspective. This new project consists
of the 4 hard-working members of Fully Developed creating an app; a tracking system for mental and emotional health.<br><br>
We also have included the use of WhatsApp in our communication process for A3 to allow group voice calls to discuss and
prioritise our tasks.<br></p>

<br><br>
Isaac Newland | Cyber Security Manager<br><br>
Isaac’s interest in the role of a Cyber Security Manager presents as the most lucrative of the Fully Developed team.
The sector has seen the strongest growth year-on-year, 37% since 2012 (expected to continue until 2022), and currently short near
3 million professionals. <br><br>
As technology spills into all facets of our lives, at lightning speed, the inherent risk of cyber threat grows respectively.
The complexity within the role of a Cyber Security Manager would vary greatly from one to the other, dependant on the needs of
the department, business, industry they’re serving; the perceived threat to a bank would vary greatly to that of Tesla.<br><br>
The skills required of Isaac to work in cyber security are of far greater complexity than that of his team mates; Isaac would be expected
to prevent, identify, disable and recover from potential threats, in place to protect data, like that of his Fully Developed team mates,
while also protecting others data from them!<br><br><br>

Addie Priaulx | Data Business Analyst<br><br>
Addie Priaulx`s role has stayed the same since Assessment 2, and it seems that the demand for Data Business Analysts is at quite at a
reasonable 34% job growth rate. This puts this job at second place between the group members with Isaac being in first place.
This career involves deriving data so that ideas can be presented to management and stakeholders of companies, in order to maximise
business productivity and effectiveness. <br><br>
There are certain skills required for this role including; knowledge in programming languages such as Python, SQL and VBA, experience
in spreadsheet software such as Excel, the ability to interpret and visualise data, warehouse data, furthermore being able to convey
trends, forecasts and solutions to stakeholders. <br><br>
Out of the team members jobs, each share similar skills in order to receive those roles, the most common similarities being;
programming skills, communications skills and experience in computer systems. <br><br>
Data Business Analyst`s must work hard to interpret data, gather information and report back to their superiors. A lot of
time and effort must be put into this role, we can see that Data Business Analysts are essential for functional and successful businesses.
<br><br><br>

Gabriel Vorster | Lead Game Designer<br><br>
There’s a healthy 8% growth in the area of game design, a promising sign to Fully Developed team member, Gabriel, as the industry
was affected throughout the global recession. Thankfully, where the maturation of technology and AI are transforming jobs as we
know them, the gaming industry and role of a Game Designer are no exceptions.<br><br>
The industry is poised for transformation, VR/AR gaming is growing, businesses are racing to become the dominant cloud gaming
platform (much like the gaming equivalent of Netflix), esports is to expect 70% by 2023 and businesses are largely reinvigorating
their business model, i.e. becoming open source and driving revenue by initiatives (such as) in-game micropayments.<br><br>
What differentiates Gabriel’s interest from the rest of the Fully Developed team is that his work will likely be contract based,
contracted on to complete a project for a release on a specified date. Furthermore, Gabriel will require exposure and understanding
to game engines such as Unity or Unreal, and be more familiar with programming languages C# and/or C++.
<br><br><br>

Jack Millar | IT Portfolio Financial Analyst<br><br>
Jack’s interest in the financial market based role is the more niche IT job prospect of the team. Although an emerging industry,
experts are predicting strong growth towards 2024. <br><br>
The financial industry within Australia has come under a great deal of scrutiny following the Global Financial Crisis,
and more recently, the Royal Commission into the Financial sector. Thi coupled with a boom in the Fin-Tech industry over the
past decade, has lead to many previously team based job opportunities, such as Portfolio analysis, being shifted to IT
based systems with one employee having to manage the system.<br><br>
With such a niche role, the job opportunities are not yet large, although Jack believes that with the expansion of the
market over the coming years this will become less prevalent. Also in order to tap into this market, a broad skill set
of not only IT knowledge, but strong financial market and investment analysis knowledge would also be vital.
