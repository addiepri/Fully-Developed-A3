						<p style="text-align:justify;">Fully developed have used the framework from one of our team members Isaac’s project idea, as we see value in the
							real world application. We aim to build a program that acts as a product selector, and serviceability calculator
							for the finance & investment industry. This would be utilised by either individuals at home or sales departments
							of financial intermediaries for the process of establishing client’s eligibility for certain products. These financial
							products can include credit cards, mortgages, superannuation products or basic bank accounts.  The idea is this program
							will be used as an initial building block, prior to an in depth evaluation of the clients serviceable income and expenditure.
							The program may be suitable for full qualification of the service if it was something as simple as opening a savings account,
							although would need further clarification for in depth assessments in order to derive the eligibility for complex items such
							as debt based products.<br><br>
How it works <br>
This project will operate with a ‘three phase’ approach, giving the client a start to finish evaluation on their financial need.<br><br>

Phase One: Initially the client will input all of their current financial details, including items such as all income, expenditure, debt and savings.<br>
Phase two: In this phase the client will outline their financial goals. This would be limited to roughly two financial goals to begin with,
but can be expanded as the project grows.<br>
Phase three: This phase will give the client both the recommended financial strategy, as well as an option to look at current financial
products they would be eligible to obtain. <br><br>
This three phase approach will allow us to not only grasp the client’s needs through separate stages, but also would streamline our
functionality, with each stage leading clients onto the next page in the sequence.<br><br>
As this project has been kept very broad, it can also be utilised by financial intermediaries looking to only provide recommendations
on their own products. With our system as the functional skeleton, we could adjust and edit the application to suit the functional
need of day to day operations of a company or organisation. From a financial perspective, this also allows for the system to be much
more adaptable and marketable for many applications.<br><br>
Skills & Tech <br>
The system itself would take some complex Java-script and HTML building in order to not only create a functional system,
but also to ensure the user interface allows potential clients to easily navigate through the three phase approach. We would
first build the financial modelling systems in java and transfer them across to run simultaneously with the rest of the system.
In order to execute this project, part of our team would be based on the financial compliance sector. This will allow us to operate
autonomously with the every changing financial sector, in order to maintain our compliant practice.<br><br>
A marketing team would also need to be put in place in order to show the versatility of the new product. The financial industry is
already so saturated with Fin-tech options, we would need to show potential clients and consumers how our product would bring
a positive impact to their finances or business models. In the Australian market now would be the best time to push such a system
with so much distrust currently standing against the financial industry. Following the royal commission consumers are much less
trusting of larger institutions, so the use of a personalised home based financial tool could appeal more than the idea of a
financial planner or banker trying to ‘make a sale.’ <br><br>
This project would also require someone with software development skills. These skills would consist of; knowledge of programming
languages (especially java), both front-end and back-end skills, problem solving skills and experience in software development.
In order to produce the end result of the project, our team will use programming software; Eclipse. This application enables us
to write java code effectively, the software developer will be using Eclipse to write java code and atom for any html that is needed.</p>
